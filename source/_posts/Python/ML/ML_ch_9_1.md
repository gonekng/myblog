# Sequential data
- meaningful in order such as text data, time series data
- Requires the function to remember previously entered data

## Text data
- text mining (representatively, sentimental analysis)
- natural language processing (using chatbot)
- basic deep learning algorithm : RNN, LSTM
  + tensorflow: https://wikidocs.net/book/2155
  + pytorch: https://wikidocs.net/32471

# RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- the contrary of feedfoward neural network
- Fully connected layer + Loop that circulates the processing flow of previous data
  + timestep : a step in processing a sample
- activation : default tanh (S-shape, -1 to 1)



```python

```
